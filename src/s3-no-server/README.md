# Fine Uploader S3: Uploading file to S3 without writing any server-side code

### All you need is a simple HTTP server to host the HTML/javascript files.

There is a live demo using this code at https://fineuploader-s3-client-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html.

Please read the [blog post that covers this example][1] in detail.

You can also read more on Fine Uploader's client-side signing feature (new as of 4.2) on the [associated feature's
documentation page][2].
